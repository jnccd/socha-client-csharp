# C# client for Software-Challenge Germany 2022/2023

This repository contains a simple client for the game "Hey, Danke f√ºr den Fisch" written for the .NET Core platform.

Because it is a simple client, it will only do seemingly random moves. If you wish to build your own client on top of this one you can [clone this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and add your code to the `Logic.cs` class in the `socha-client-csharp` folder.

## Usage

This project can either be used with Visual Studio 2022 on Windows by opening the .sln file or with another IDE such as Visual Studio Code on any operating system.

To run this project in the latter case cd into the `socha-client-csharp` folder and use the `run` command of .NET.

```dotnet run```

If you wish to pass program arguments to the `dotnet ` execution you can use `--` like so:

```dotnet run -- --help```
